# **Homework week 3 README**

## This contains a 3 html documents, 2 images, 1 CSS and a ReadMe file.

**These each include the following elements:** 
*(i) Contact.html includes a bootstrap contact me form - without functionality from javascript or php;*
*(ii) Portfolio.html has many placeholder images and corresponding text ready for when I have projects I can put into that portfolio;*
*(iii) index.html is an about me page, it includes a picture of myself (I have yet to take a professional image so this one will have to do for now) basic information concerning my general goals and links to social media;*
*(iv) I included two images - the placeholder.jpg to be used on the portfolio page and the me.jpg used on the About Me page;*
*(v) The CSS does what it says on the tin, it styles the various pages;*
*(vi) The ReadMe - well... you're reading it right now aren't you;*
